I've felt their songs on the bottoms of my feet
and their flies have curled around my face.

I saw the hero return unwelcomed to his mother's country,
a schoolboy heart soured by the sea and
sky wracked upon the stones of one more
ancient city, one more ancient hillspeak
forged unlearned ages previous above the mottled brows
of an evacuated people.

I saw him coming in morning to pay no attention
then creeping lackluster at night's fall
amidst the throng in a practiced laze
his hair perfect for no-one
his body a thousand year temple
burnished flawless by the ageless salt
lapping again, again.

So friendly their waters
so forgiving their songs
enshrining the most minuscule transgressions
while they slay so effortlessly whatever benefits them
always calling the other side of the mountain "they".
