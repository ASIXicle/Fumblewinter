      <div class="poem-body">
On my skin a bit of the regular shame scent
credent yet impaired, imparted to remind
my shallow, shallow self of what is acquired
by a hand badgered and dumb

still swollen from the rush of swordplay
still frozen from the frost of Virginian winter
still firm from the choke of my enemy
still smooth from the bath bore by my widow
still vermin that spurns the offered shield
the offered cloak
the offered bowl
the offered cane
the offered furnace
the offered veil.

That which were and that which is and that which will be
has always been for me and always will

Still I love this dread of nothing
for all of the things I have been given.
