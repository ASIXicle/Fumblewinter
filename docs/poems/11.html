The old men in Gerace do not sit often
and whole days long I've seen them milling
over this old gravel
this pack of rocks resting as always
tender

Being fed and a bit of wine
and time, time is
comfortable
as it walks the Borgo and
considers pausing
among the cats and garbage
and fallen down churches

those men turn with three steps
like animated tripods
and climb back to the top.
