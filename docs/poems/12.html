The click of women cutting at plates
my leg covered in smashed ants
scorned corpses smeared and not eaten

The odor of zucchini.

Pulling logs across cobbles
descend exhausted to stare
at malingering cats and ripe leaves
each painted for the sun's permission
to feed sugar to water
to molest the minds of men
perfectly

chirp chirp chirp

The birds at the table curious
their legs nervous
a pet a pet

They stay in a dangerous way
pondering wine and the shave
of skin petting against
skin

in the doldrums of mezzogiorno we take
baths in each other's ignorance
our eager arms flapping.
