There is something of pigfilth to it all
as if the town itself were acrid,
ammoniated, offensive to an old god
who has contrived to punish all here
in the old-fashioned manner of annoyances.

They all still keep on though, don't they
regardless of the trifles
though I think I prefer to
respect the likes of Paestum
a community that rejected it's curses.

As would I, except that I am not
unsure why, except that perhaps
I believe I've something to learn from them,
uncertain if they are even my kin.
