That word they use for laughter is so peculiar
in its similarity to my word for
to tear asunder.

Brought out plain in her eyelids
and at their edge, their remarkable edge
the famous affinity of love
rendered in a curl indiscernible
without sound.

Might the lowering of clouds to the earth
compound air and leaves
forge and heavy the uninterested soil
that sinks and rises and salves the wounded
bent all at once to broker with the dust
for one more day year and minute
with her loveliness.
