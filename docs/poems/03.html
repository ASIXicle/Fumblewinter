misfit savant broke the mother's wall
and slain from the womb choked aloud
first sound for another bungling
broad-fat of flesh, here for all of you
but mostly himself.

in the 'ole man's backyard holding a brush against the wall
stood pouting, forever entranced with that big white
for it is only in a photograph that this instance exists and
not at all in my mind.

I've no particle of a recollection of this
moment

I've a perfect intuition of it and am convinced
truly

It existed as an ideal beginning.

I do recall the awful days of summer
towing back and forth the mower, the heaving
heat and glued grass and odor of gasoline
thinking while I paced out that lawn behind
that machine as it belched, snorted, chopped
of the girls I fancied to fuck and the elaborate
opportunities that might one day prevail
to give me a nose-full of cunt

astringent air all accursed with grassy signal
blade to blade, he is coming.

<span class="section-marker">III.</span>
shorn from me
that moment made epistemological
when traveling the Turnpike in Albany my mother
turned and spoke she said
something I will never remember that sent
the flock of lies flying she sent
the world another cadaver to embalm
another fox to arouse the hens
another diary of poor riddles to be written.

please I've always asked "please"
and they never did, did they
but for a few and for them I warm and smile
and think of grandfather

what brutal crutches fastened to his elbows
what a forlorn fuckheaded nightmare of a life to abide
what for it, but empty beer cans and a crucifix

I love you, oh god I love you!

echoes of smallness like a turned-out window or
a scolded mirror flattening the image around a corner
duller, more vague in it's comprehension
that I've caught only a moment ago.
