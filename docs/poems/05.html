It is almost time to pluck the strawberries from their beds,
twined lovely among the lines of grapevines,
the fortified luster of shade seeming to eroticize the earth.

I hear behind me the careful breathing
of an attentive lover as he shoulders
his bride on his hips, their pulse and pour being
everything that is beautiful to me.
