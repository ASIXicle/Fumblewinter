The shellshocked ripeness of lackjoy
curling about the windows
yellow fingerfeeling around the window sill
squatting and perched
cold outside-in

Mouthing ringsounds with the sunshine
mouth agape, the dullards appetite for
a circled heart sent
sent
sent

Making those lovelies open and close
shuttered scornless among the daisies
and the light once fed upon
noses up against the pane
litup on the floor allspent and holy

Then thinking of cold becomes allthink
and of itself
as all
always thinking
of colddread
reeling away from it
cushioning against the glassface of whatspast
and therein
and thereupon

Glowchar thrilling the vast unhappened
reflected back to your candletip
stared at
spoken to
dignified as a shred of existence
meantobe and valuable

Otherthan heatspeak bragging its best qualities
only.
