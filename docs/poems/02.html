You are better for it
so then won't you
miserably fashion words in a manner to
call the chaps diamonds
or forge a new opinion of yourself.

No.

Instead crease the daylight with the taunt of hello
grimaced from a mouth begging
the pardon of propriety

Your convivial affection
no matter the alarming falsity
or the obscenity
of all these day-times you've maligned
been fond to invite
then to entertain.

Buckle the shade of mid-day with a groan of agreement
guttered from the low of your throat
coerced from a nod to assuage doubt.

No men mattered more to me
or less to my memory
than those I lilted through their loss
with drink and handshakes and solemn oaths
to never make a mistake again.
